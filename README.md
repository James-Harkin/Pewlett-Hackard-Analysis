# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
With the boomer generation approaching retirement age, Bobby's company needs to look ahead and determine the best plan of action for training and replacing employees as they retire.

Summary: 
* We produced a list for employees who are born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. And that told us who might retire soon and how many there are.
* The size of that list was 123456 employees
* Pewlett Hackard has enough employees to properly train the new replacements. We produced a sheet of over 1500 possible mentors. These mentors have experence, and they are above the age of 55 but not about to retire.
